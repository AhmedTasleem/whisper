More information on how these models were trained and evaluated can be found [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356).\n## Model Details\nThe Whisper models are trained for speech recognition and translation tasks, capable of transcribing speech audio into the text in the language it is spoken (ASR) as well as translated into English (speech translation). Researchers at OpenAI developed the models to study the robustness of speech processing systems trained under large-scale weak supervision. There are 9 models of different sizes and capabilities, summarized in the following table.\n|  Size  | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model |  \n|:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|"

We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\nOur models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data.

While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects."
